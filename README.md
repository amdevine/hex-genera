# Hexadecimal Scientific Names

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for an analysis of scientific names as potential hexadecimal color codes.

Scientific names were considered to be hexadecimal codes if they could be used to represent a color. Names were therefore limited to 3 or 6 characters, containing only the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F.

## Results

There are seven accepted scientific names (all genera) that meet the criteria for being hexadecimal colors:

- Aaaaba (beetles)
- Aceeca (worms)
- Addaea (moths)
- Beebea (moths)
- Cadaba (flowers)
- Cea (wasps)
- Feddea (sunflowers)
